# Raycasting-rs
A very buggy and not-well-functioning Raycaster made in Rust and Raylib.
I also made another version in C++ which has less bugs and problems.

[C++ version](https://github.com/ReiettoAyanami/Raycasting-cpp)

# Next updates.
This version is going to get a revamp soon, since i want this to be on the same level as the C++ one.

The to-do list is:
- Fixing fisheye
- Sharing objects in a better way
- Make so every wall will be able to render with a different color.

# Special thanks
My psichiatrist for telling me the people in the walls aren't real and the voices in my head are wrong.
